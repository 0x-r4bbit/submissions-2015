  Title: Fast from the Start
  Description: >
    Nothing is more frustrating than a slow web app.
    Yet, too often, performance is not considered until end users begin to
    complain about frustrating experiences.
    Tobias and Jeff will talk about tools and methods that were used to make
    Angular 2 fast from the start, and how these tools and
    methods can be applied to other web applications as well.
