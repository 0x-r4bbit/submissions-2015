  Title: Angular 1.3 meets Angular 2.0
  Description: >
    A lot of Angular 2.0 proposals rely on established best practices from existing Angular 1.3
    apps. In this talk I'll show how one can organize the Angular 1.3 project so that it's easier
    to find one's way in a large code base and migrate to Angular 2.0 in the future.
