  Title: Angular + React = Speed
  Description: >
    How we integrated React into our Angular directives at HireVue to give them
    super turbo speed boost power.

    At HireVue, we found that some of our directives were slow and janky. After
    identifying the cause of the slowness in the DOM, we were able to switch to
    React for the DOM rendering, and we got a huge performance boost.

    This talk will walk you through what we did, and how we are building React-
    based directives now, including our pattern for i18n.
