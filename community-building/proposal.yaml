  Title: "Community Building How-To: Make More Angular Devs Now"
  Description: >
    Angular's success depends on a thriving community. The apps that we create can
    better serve the world if our diversity reflects the diversity of our audience. How
    can we attract more developers of all kinds to Angular, and reach out to underrepresented
    groups? In this talk, I will draw upon my learnings from creating communities in gaming and
    programming, with a case study of RailsbridgeSF's success in gender diversity outreach
    and its effects on other programming communities. This talk is a call to action with
    concrete steps you can take to foster inclusion in the Angular community in your own home
    city. Angular needs you, and the time is now.
