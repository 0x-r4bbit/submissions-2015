  Title: Run digest cycle in web worker
  Description: >
    Browser freezes while the digest cycle runs. What if we could keep our
    angular application the same but offload the digest cycle to separate
    thread in a web worker? Well, we can!
    I published the step by step micro angular example that makes it possible
    in the blog post http://bahmutov.calepin.co/run-angular-digest-cycle-in-web-worker.html
    Please see the post for the content.
