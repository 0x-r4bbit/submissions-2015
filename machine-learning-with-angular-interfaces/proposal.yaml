  Title: Using Angular to give your apps eyes
  Description: >
    Although computer vision has existed for a long time, it has largely been used in academic libraries and large, complex applications. With the speed of computers increasing and at an unprecedented rate, computer vision is becoming easier to integrate into lower-cost, applicatons and is ready for the prime time. 
    In this talk, we'll work through an application we've been developing combining machine learning and computer vision and how we've used the flexibility of Angular to power the front-end.
