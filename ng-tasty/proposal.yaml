  Title: ngTasty - Building performante reusable UI components
  Description: >
    Every quarter we complete a project and move on to a new one. This results in a nececity to build
    reusable components that we can improve upon. With each new project we improve performance of the
    compnents used and thereby improve the perfomrance of previously built applications.
    To meet this need I built ng-tasty. A lightweight, flexible, and tasty collection of reusable
    UI components that my team uses every day at Twitter in many internal products.
    With input from Jeff Cross, I will discuss how we focus on performance when designing reusable components
    that are measurably fast using Benchpress and Batarang.
