  Title: ngTasty - Building high performance measurable directives
  Description: >
    Every quarter at Twitter my team completes a project and moves on to a new one. This results in a nececity to build
    reusable components that we can improve upon. With each new project we improve performance of the
    compnents used by all of our applcations. With input from Jeff Cross, I will discuss how we focus
    on performance when designing reusable components that are measurably fast. You may already know
    abuot Batarang, but how can you use it in conjuction with Benchpress to design, measure, and
    identify specififc areas of improvement in your application? I will present real-life examples
    from our ngTasty implementations at Twitter that demonstate how you can use these tools together to
    develop the fastest directive you have ever made.
