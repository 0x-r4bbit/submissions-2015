  Title: Why Realtime Matters
  Description: >
    The future of the web is realtime, but the way we develop apps is still based off of the CRUD model.
    CRUD is a pattern that keeps us blind to updates on the server. It's time to ditch the CRUD model
    and the $http service. Now is the time to start syncing our data in realtime.
    
    In this talk we'll will examine the limitations of a CRUD app. Then using Firebase we'll gut out the
    $http service, and evolve it to a realtime app with AngularFire.
